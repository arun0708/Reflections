do git init so git starts tracing your files and directories
staging area is a place for files/fir to be commited, it gives flexibility of picking and choosing which files to be committed

make sure all needed changes for one logical change are added to staging area
diff --staged to see diff between staged and commit before commiting

use branches when you are working on a different or experimental feature from  master branch

branch diagrams tells you the structure of branches, which commits are reachable etc.,


merging two branches together merges the history of both branches and log sorts them by timestamps and a new branch is created, old branch can be deleted
