When would you want to create a remore rep instead of keeping all the work locally
  - when you want to make a copy in cloud and or collaborate with other people

Do it manually - pulling from remote so you control your local master

for when you do not have permission from repo owner but you want to give credit.you may have to merge it back if you have done sufficient improvements with permission of owner

clone when you want to copy things to your local disk (whole repo)

Branch when you want to work on a specific feature


Benefit of local copy of last know state of remote repo is to work offline, do a git diff with remote after git fetch to see what has been developed in remote


Git hub collabs gives you the power of multiple people working together, keeping track of history,working offline etc. without git hub 2 poeple could work together or we have to use code diff tools it will be painful

make changes in a separate branch if you are going to work for a long time on your own - so you can keep merging to remote master through fetch
