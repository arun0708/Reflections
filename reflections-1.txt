Interesting discussion on diffing two files
google doc is not a software system and does not support multiple file changes
git is uusally used to support software systems, which has multiple file depenencies
use git diff c1# c2# --stat to see the total additions/deletions
if I make a mistake I could checjout past versions to find the commit which introduced the bug
use git effectovely for ZOP's
